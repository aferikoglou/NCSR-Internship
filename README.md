# Chimera patterns in 2D networks of coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons

In this project we recreated part of the results of the paper __Chimera patterns in two-dimensional networks of coupled neurons__ in __docs__ folder. We created a simulation of a network of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators coupled in a two-dimensional toroidal geometry in order to observe the *Chimera States* that arise. For the simulation algorithm we used [Euler method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method) and [Runge-Kutta method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods) with two and four stages. In order to accelarate the simulation we used [OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP) API. Part of the simulations was executed in [ARIS HPC](https://hpc.grnet.gr/en/supercomputer/).

> Equations (2a) and (2b) of the paper __Chimera patterns in two-dimensional networks of coupled neurons__ were printed incorrectly. The term with the summation must be subtracted from the rest of the equation.

The simulation program gets as command line arguments the name of the output folder and a set of simulation parameters (grid size, coupling radius, coupling phase, simulation time and seed for the random initial conditions generator). The simulation creates a *.dat* file every 20 time units that contains the potential value of each neuron in the grid. It also creates a *.dat* file for the mean phase velocity of each neuron in the grid, a *.dat* file for the mean phase velocity horizontal cut (the cut is made for j = 50) and a *.dat* file with the total simulation time. After the simulation is finished a python script creates *.png* files for each potential *.dat* file, for the mean phase velocity *.dat* file and the mean phase velocity horizontal cut *.dat* file. Finally, a *.gif* file is created to demonstrate the potential evolution through time.
