# Chimera patterns in 2D networks of coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons

In this project we recreated part of the results of the paper entitled __Chimera patterns in two-dimensional networks of coupled neurons__ in docs folder. We created a simulation of a network of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators coupled in a two-dimensional toroidal geometry in order to observe the __Chimera States__ that arise. For the simulation algorithm we used __Euler__ numerical method and __Runge-Kutta__ numerical method with two and four stages. For the acceleration of the simulation we used __OpenMP API__.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
